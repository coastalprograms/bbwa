# Architectural and Design Patterns

- **Monolith Architecture**: A single, unified application for both the front end and back end, which is ideal for an MVP to ensure simplicity and fast deployment.

- **Component-Based UI**: The front end will be built using a component-based approach with Next.js and React, promoting reusability and maintainability.

- **Serverless Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions will be used for specific tasks to provide a secure and scalable way to handle custom logic.

- **Repository Pattern**: We will abstract the data access logic from the business logic to enable testing and future database migration flexibility.

- **Event-Driven Communication**: Supabase hooks will trigger webhooks to an external automation platform (like Make.com or n8n) for tasks like sending notifications.
