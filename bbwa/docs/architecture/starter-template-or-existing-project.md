# Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD), this is a new project being built from scratch. It will use Next.js, with Supabase as the primary backend, and is intended to be hosted on Netlify. No existing codebases or starter templates were provided, so the architecture will be designed from a greenfield perspective.
