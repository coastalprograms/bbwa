# Coding Standards

- **Languages**: TypeScript (strict mode) for all app code; Markdown for docs using Australian English spelling.
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router. Use Server Components by default; mark Client Components only when necessary.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid custom global CSS except framework resets. Prefer Shadcn/ui components for consistency.
- **Naming**:
  - Files: kebab-case (e.g., `project-card.tsx`), React components PascalCase, hooks `useXxx.ts`.
  - Folders: feature-based, kebab-case (e.g., `projects/`, `workers/`).
  - Exports: use barrel `index.ts` where it improves DX.
- **Imports Order**: external libs, absolute aliases, internal modules, relative paths. No unused imports.
- **Components**:
  - Functional components with explicit props interfaces.
  - Keep files under ~300 lines; split where needed.
  - Accessibility: follow WCAG 2.2 (labels, focus states, keyboard nav, contrast).
- **State & Data**:
  - Server Actions with proper error handling (try/catch) and typed responses.
  - Supabase `createClient()` pattern in server modules; never expose secrets in Client Components.
  - Clean up real-time subscriptions.
- **Security**:
  - Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables (enforced in DB stories).
  - Validate inputs on both client and server; never trust client data.
  - Use environment variables; do not hardcode secrets.
- **Performance & SEO**:
  - Optimise Core Web Vitals; use `next/image` and dynamic imports where appropriate.
  - Provide metadata and OpenGraph where needed; generate sitemaps later.
- **Testing & QA**:
  - Lint and type-check must pass in CI.
  - Provide smoke tests for key routes and components.
- **Commits & Docs**:
  - Conventional Commits. Keep README/feature docs up to date.
